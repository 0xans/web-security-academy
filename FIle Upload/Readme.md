# What is File Upload Vulnerabilities

File upload vulnerability is a common security flaw in web applications that allows attackers to upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to severe consequences such as data breaches or Remote Code Execution (RCE) if not adequately mitigated.

## Example of Vulnerable Code

```php
$target_dir = "uploads/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
    echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars( basename( $_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"])). " has been uploaded.";
} else {
    echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
}

```
*The code lacks file extension validation enabling attackers to upload malicious files with disguised extensions which can be executed on the server*

## Impact of File Upload Vulnerabilities

1. **Confidentiality**:
   - These vulnerabilities may lead to the exposure of sensitive user data, compromising the integrity of the underlying database.

2. **Integrity**:
   - File upload vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or alter content within the application's database, leading to data integrity issues.

3. **Availability**:
   - Attackers may exploit file upload vulnerabilities to delete crucial content within the application, affecting its availability and functionality.

## How to Detect File Upload Vulnerabilities

- **Manual Code Review**: Examine the source code for insecure file upload functionalities, focusing on input validation and file handling.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Utilize automated tools to analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Black Box Testing**: Mimic external attackers to identify vulnerabilities through comprehensive testing.

## How Attackers Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities

- Uploading malicious files containing executable code or script.
- Manipulating file names or metadata to evade detection and execute malicious actions.
- Leveraging uploaded files to execute arbitrary commands or escalate privileges on the server.

## How to Prevent File Upload Vulnerabilities

- **File Type and Extension Validation**: Validate file types based on content and extension to restrict uploads to trusted formats.
- **File Size Limit**: Implement restrictions on file sizes to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and resource exhaustion.
- **Secure File Storage**: Store uploaded files outside the web root directory to prevent direct access and execution.
- **Content Disposition**: Set appropriate Content Disposition headers to prevent browsers from executing uploaded files as scripts.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to provide informative messages without revealing sensitive information.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities proactively.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to control resource loading and mitigate the risk of script execution from uploaded files.
